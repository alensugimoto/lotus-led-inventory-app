# The Lotus Inventory App

This app turns files containing tables into simple, searchable, syncable lists of data.

You just need to upload a file to the app, and you will be able to effortlessly navigate through the contents of its data tables without Internet connection.

It is also integrated with Google Driveâ„¢ and Dropbox, allowing you to refresh and read the most up-to-date version of your files with just one click.

And in case you forget, the app lets you know when your data was last refreshed and reminds you to press the refresh button once in a while.
